Did you see the latest announcement from Defcon about the badge this year? So did we! We love CTFs and suspect that the two GPIO pins on the badge this year might be used during the badge challenge this year so NilbinSec is publishing a really shitty SAO (like our shard last year) to enable interaction with the GPIO pins for anyone who might need it.

The gerber file has already been shared on OSHPark, and is probably the cheapest, quickest way to get yourself one of these badges before Defcon this year if you plan on working on the badge challenge.

# USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
We can't stress this enough, we only have a single image provided by the Defcon organizers https://x.com/defcon/status/1808279118477418640

We are uncertain what the intent of these GPIO pins are for and what if any functionality they might have in the base badge. But with the risks, we wanted to make sure people that might need something like this have it available to interact with their badges. Just recognize that there is a risk anytime you start hacking one something.
